# Arduino LCD_WH4004A Library
Ardunio library for WH4004a and compatible lcd displays.
This modified library allows an Arduino board to control Winstar WH4004A and compatible 
40 character x 4 line LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780
(or a compatible) chipset. This library supports the 2 independant controllers of the
display, one for lines 1 and 2 and the second for lines 3 and 4 by the use of 2 separate 
enable lines.
